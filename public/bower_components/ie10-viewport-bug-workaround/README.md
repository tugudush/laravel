## Installation

## Bugs
With coming of Bootstrap 4 I hope there will be no changes, but if you find something, please submit an issue [here](https://github.com/jdrda/ie10-viewport-bug-workaround/issues). 

### Why this repo
As only respository found for this workaround https://github.com/Haixing-Hu/bootstrap3-ie10-viewport-bug-workaround
has no update, so the CSS file is not available, I decided to make a new one.
